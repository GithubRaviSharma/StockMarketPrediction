# Stock Market Prediction Project

This project aims to predict stock market trends using Watson Studio, focusing on the BSE Sensex and Nifty Fifty indexes. The repository is organized into three folders: one detailing the steps to follow for prediction using Watson Studio, another containing BSE Sensex prediction data, code, and output, and the third containing NSE turnover prediction data, code, and output.

## About Watson Studio:

Watson Studio is an integrated environment designed to help data scientists, developers, and domain experts collaborate and accelerate the process of building and deploying AI and machine learning models. It provides a suite of tools for data preparation, model development, and deployment in a scalable and secure environment.

## About BSE Sensex and Nifty Fifty Indexes:

1. BSE Sensex: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex is one of the most widely followed stock market indices in India. It consists of 30 well-established and financially sound companies listed on the BSE, representing various sectors of the Indian economy. The Sensex serves as a barometer of the Indian stock market's overall performance.

2. Nifty Fifty: The Nifty Fifty, officially known as the Nifty 50, is another prominent stock market index in India. It comprises 50 large-cap, actively traded stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Similar to the Sensex, the Nifty Fifty index reflects the overall performance of the Indian equity market and is widely used by investors and analysts for benchmarking purposes.
